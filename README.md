## Requirements

- Elixir `1.14+` with Erlang/OTP `25+`
- Git

---

## Installation

### Install Elixir

Elixir runs on the Erlang virtual machine, so **Erlang/OTP is required** Elixir cannot run without
it. Every package manager below installs Erlang/OTP for you as a dependency. The only path that needs
a separate Erlang step is the Windows manual installer (see below).

**Windows:**

*Option A package manager (recommended, installs Erlang automatically):*

```cmd
winget install Elixir.Elixir
```

*Option B manual installer (two installers, in this order):*

1. Download and run the **Erlang/OTP installer** from https://www.erlang.org/downloads
2. Run `erl -s halt` to check which OTP version you got
3. Download the **Elixir installer built for that exact OTP** from https://elixir-lang.org/install.html (`elixir-otp-<N>.exe`) and run it

Then open Command Prompt and verify:

```cmd
elixir --version
```

The output prints both versions, for example `Elixir 1.14.0 (compiled with Erlang/OTP 25)`.

**Linux (Ubuntu / Debian):**

```bash
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install -y elixir
elixir --version
```

**macOS:**

```bash
brew install elixir
elixir --version
```

> If you do not have Homebrew, install it first from https://brew.sh

**Termux (Android):**

```bash
pkg update && pkg upgrade -y
pkg install elixir -y
elixir --version
```

> If the `elixir` package is not available in your Termux repository, install an Ubuntu environment first with `pkg install proot-distro`, then `proot-distro install ubuntu`, then `proot-distro login ubuntu` and run the Linux command above inside it.

### Clone and Install

**Clone the repository:**

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Yuurisan-N1/Jvault-Miniapp.git
cd Jvault-Miniapp
```

**Install dependencies:**

This bot uses only the Elixir standard library, so there is nothing to install. Erlang/OTP was already installed by the step above.

---

## Configuration

### 1. Accounts (data.txt)

Fill `data.txt` with Telegram WebApp `initData` for each account, one per line:

```
user=%7B%22id%22...&hash=abc123
user=%7B%22id%22...&hash=def456
```

> `initData` can be obtained from the browser DevTools when opening the JVault Miner Miniapp on Telegram Web. The account is identified by the `initData` itself, so no separate id column is needed.

### 2. Proxy (proxy.txt)

Fill `proxy.txt` with proxies, one per line (optional, leave empty to run without proxy):

```
host:port
host:port:user:pass
http://user:pass@host:port
```

Proxies are assigned to accounts by index in round-robin order.

### 3. Bot Settings (config.json)

`sleep_seconds` controls how many seconds the bot waits between cycles. If `config.json` is missing, it is created automatically with a default of `3600` seconds.

```json
{
  "settings": {
    "sleep_seconds": 3600
  }
}
```

---

## Running the Bot

**Linux / macOS:**

```bash
elixir --erl "+Bd" bot.exs
```

**Windows:**

```cmd
elixir --erl "+Bc" bot.exs
```

Or just double click `run_pc.bat`, which runs the Windows command above.

## Features

### Account State
At the start of every account the bot opens the session and logs the account name together with the current total assets. A banned account is reported and skipped before any other request is sent.

### Tap Mining
The tap rail is drained in a paced burst, one tap at a time, and the credited amount is not taken from the request: the bot re-reads the account afterwards and logs the real balance gain, so a tap burst that credited nothing is never reported as a reward. A tap that the server answers with its pacing refusal is retried on the next slot instead of being logged as a failure.

### Mining Cycle
When the mining cycle timer has run out the bot claims it. When the cycle is still running the bot prints how much time is left and moves straight on to the next phase it never parks the cycle on a multi-hour countdown, so every account is processed on every pass. The claimed amount is the balance gain the bot re-reads after the claim.

### Task Rewards
Every task from the task list is claimed in order. A task that still requires a manual channel join is reported as such and skipped, and a task that was already completed is passed over instead of being claimed twice. When the list is empty the bot says so once.

### Referral Bonus
The invite bonus and the team commission are collected when the server reports one pending. Accounts with nothing pending are reported as such.

### Leaderboard
The account's own position is read from the leaderboard the server publishes and printed together with the account name. An account that is not ranked yet is reported as such.

### Multi Account
All accounts in `data.txt` are processed sequentially within every cycle. Each account block starts with its own proxy line, and blocks are separated by one blank line so the mapping between an account and its egress is auditable in the log.

### Proxy Support
Proxies are loaded from `proxy.txt` and assigned to accounts by position in round-robin order. Proxy credentials are masked in log output. Running without proxies is fully supported.

### Auto Countdown
Every wait inside the cycle displays a live `HH:MM:SS` countdown in place, and after all accounts complete a cycle the bot shows a countdown until the next cycle starts. A mining cycle that is still counting down is reported as a single line instead, so it never stalls the rest of the cycle.
